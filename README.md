# ekg_tda
This is an algorithm which detects EKG features using persistent homology and then measures the PR,QT,ST-interval, QRS-duration, P-wave duration, and T-wave duration based off of the
upper and lower time axis bounds of the representative cycles of the detected features within the dataset. There are also flags which indicate atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and 
first-degree AV block.
